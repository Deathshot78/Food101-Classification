## 🎯 Project Highlights

- **High-Performance Model** ⚡: Utilizes a pre-trained `EfficientNetV2-S`, selected for its excellent balance of accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for potential edge deployment.
- **Reproducible Pipeline** 🔄: Encapsulates the entire workflow—from data loading to training and evaluation—in a clean and organized `LightningModule` and `DataModule`.
- **Efficient Experimentation** ⏱️: Overcame hardware limitations by implementing dataset subsetting for rapid prototyping.
- **Advanced Fine-Tuning** 🛠️: Implemented a robust fine-tuning strategy, unfreezing the final three blocks of the feature extractor and using the `Adam` optimizer with a `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler for stable convergence.
- **In-Depth Analysis** 🔎: Went beyond simple accuracy by calculating and logging per-class F1-scores and accuracies, enabling a deep dive into the model's strengths and weaknesses.
- **Live Deployment** 📺: The final model is deployed and accessible as an interactive Gradio web application on Hugging Face Spaces.

## 💡 Real-World Applications

Beyond being a technical challenge, this food classification model serves as a foundation for numerous real-world applications in health, hospitality, and smart home technology.

- **Health and Nutrition Tracking**
  - **Automated Calorie Counting:** Users can snap a photo of their meal, and an app can automatically identify each food item to provide an instant estimate of calories, macros, and other nutritional information.
  - **Dietary Management:** Assists individuals with allergies or specific dietary needs (e.g., diabetes, gluten-free) by helping them identify and log their food intake accurately.
- **Restaurant and Hospitality Tech**
  - **Self-Checkout Systems:** In cafeterias or quick-service restaurants, a camera-based system could identify all items on a tray to automate the billing process, reducing queues and improving efficiency.
    - **Interactive Menus:** Allow diners to point their phone at a dish to get more information, such as ingredients, allergen warnings, or customer reviews.

- **Smart Home and Appliances**
  - **Smart Refrigerators:** A fridge equipped with a camera could identify leftover dishes, suggest recipes based on available food, and help track food spoilage to reduce waste.

## 🧫 Experimental Results

This project followed an iterative approach. The table below summarizes the key experiments and their outcomes, showing the progression from the initial baseline to the final model.

| Model | Training Strategy | Data % | Key Hyperparameters | Final Val Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EfficientNet-B2` | Simple fine-tune (last block) | 50% | `lr=1e-4` | ~64% |

## 🔬 Performance Analysis and Error Diagnosis

Beyond the aggregate accuracy, a per-class analysis was conducted to identify the model's specific limitations and diagnose the root causes of misclassifications.

The model performed exceptionally well on many classes but struggled with a distinct set of categories, primarily due to visual ambiguity and high variability in appearance.

#### 🍤 Lowest-Performing Classes

The following five classes had the lowest validation accuracy:

| Class Name          | Index | Validation Accuracy |
| :------------------ | :---- | :------------------ |
| `shrimp_and_grits`  | 93    | 44.0%               |
| `ravioli`           | 77    | 59.2%               |
| `apple_pie`         | 0     | 61.6%               |
| `huevos_rancheros`  | 56    | 63.2%               |
| `falafel`           | 36    | 63.6%               |

#### 🔎 Root Cause Analysis of Misclassifications

- **High Intra-Class Variation**: The model struggled with dishes that have no single, consistent appearance.  
- **Fine-Grained Confusion**: Errors occurred between visually similar classes like `ravioli` vs. `dumplings`.  
- **Ambiguous Features**: Foods like `falafel` resemble many small fried dishes, making classification tricky.  

#### 🛠️ FutureWork

Improvements could include:

- Detailed confusion matrix analysis 🔍
- More aggressive data augmentation 📈  
- Larger architectures for fine-grained recognition 🏋️  
- Training for longer 🏋️
